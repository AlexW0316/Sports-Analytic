This project focuses on building a relatively complex model based on the model to predict the results of NFL games based on the previous 10 years' scores. We used machine learning knowledge including logistic regression, log loss, and gradient descent within the Python environment. A report of the project can be seen in this repository named as "Sports_Analytics.pdf".
